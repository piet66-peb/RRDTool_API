# RRDTool_API

is an HTTP API and a web-based user interface for round-robin databases 
created with RRDtool.

[RRDtool Beginner's Guide](https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/tut/rrd-beginners.en.html)

## Features

It provides the ability to remotely
* store data in a database (rrdupdate)
* retrieve data from a database (rrdfetch)
* create, update and display graphs (rrdgraph)
* select data from a database using an SQL like command
* call user defined web pages containing graphs

## Usage

Display the main page and the interface description with
[**http://&lt;rrd_server&gt;:5001/**](html/img/RRDTool_API_interface.png)

## Requirements

RRDTool_API runs on all operating systems with Python 3 and RRDtool.
However, all included scripts are Linux bash scripts.
<br>The operation is done via web browser. For correct formatting of the output
a JSON Viewer Plugin and a Markdown Viewer Plugin are necessary.

## Installation

The included installation scripts are written for a Debian-based Linux with 
systemd, such as Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu.    
For other operating systems, the commands need to be adapted accordingly.

#### Proceeding

* Put the API packet on any place on the rrd server. 
* Run script **00_install_flask_rrdtool.bash**
* Run script **01_install_RRDTool_API.bash**
* Adjust the settings in the **./settings.py** file to your requirements and restart the API.

## Settings

Important settings (file **./settings.py**):
* username and password
* read/write permissions
* default graph size
* path to the rrd database files

## Start - Stop

* Start API with command **sudo systemctl start RRDTool_API**.
* Stop API with command **sudo systemctl stop RRDTool_API**.

## Uninstallation

* Run script **99_do_removes.bash**.
* Delete packet folder. With this action all included database and graph files 
are deleted as well.

You can also delete the software mentioned in **00_install_flask_rrdtool.bash**, 
if no other program is using it.

## User Defined Contents

#### Database Files

RRDTool_API expects the database files in the **./rrd** subfolder. 
You can change the default folder using **./settings.py**.
Please use links if your files are stored in multiple locations. 
All database files must have the extension **.rrd**.

#### Filling the Databases

Storing data into a database can easily be done using an HTTP command. 
<br>For example, with Curl:

```
curl -sS -X POST -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD \
     http://$IP:$PORT/$RRD_NAME/update"?ts=$TIMESTAMP&values=$VALUE1:$VALUE2:..."
```

#### Graphs

In order for the API to create and update graphs, graph definitions
 must be created and stored in the **./graphs_def** folder. All definition files 
have a **.def** extension.
The generated graphs are stored in the **./graphs_img** folder.

![](html/img/example.png)

RDDTool_API provides the possibility to generate default graph definitions from
 a database file. These can then be further developed manually.


#### User Web Pages

The **./html** folder can be used to store user web pages to be called by 
the API. Please note that RRDTool_API doesn't support all features of common 
web servers. It is mainly designed to display pages with generated graphs.

#### Examples of Custom Content

Instead of a huge manual, I have included some examples covering the most interesting cases:

* In the folder **rrd/**: some create scripts and xml dumps.
* In the folder **html/**: an index.html and some webpages calling graphs in different ways.
* In the folder **graphs_def/**: some graph definition files.
* In the folder **html/cgi-bin/**: an example for running rrdcgi. I don't recommend
this, but it is possible :smirk:.

Installation and Usage:

1. Restore all rrd-files with the shell script **restore_all_rrd_from_xml.bash**
   in the folder **rrb/**.
2. Generate the necessary default graph definitions for all rrd files via UI with 
   the command **/new_graph_definition?db=<...>**.
3. Run the example pages via **/html/index.html**.

When you don't need them any more, you should remove them from the standard folders.

## Third Party Processing

The API provides a SQL-like select command. This allows remote software or 
those without their own RRDtool interface to process stored data. 
Example: Grafana with JSON API.
<br>Example with Curl:

```
curl -sSN -o - -u  $USERNAME:$PASSWORD \
     http://$IP:$PORT/sql  \
     --get --data-urlencode "=select * from $RRD_NAME where ts > $FIRST and ts <= $LAST"
```

## Public Use

The RRDTool_API has a built-in web server. It is safe to use in a trusted 
environment. So far it is not intended to be used in public. It is also not 
investigated what that would entail.
